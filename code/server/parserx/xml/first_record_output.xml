		<dc:description xml:lang="en-US"> Epistaxis is defined as bleeding from the nasal cavity. It is actually a Greek word for nose bleed. Itis actually a very common problem and hence its incidence is rather difficult to access. Crudeestimates or its incidence ranges from 5  14% 1. The incidence of epistaxis also shows significantincrease during winter months / hot dry climates with low humidity. This climatic increase inincidence of epistaxis has been attributed to increase in the incidence of upper respiratory tractinfections. Forceful blowing of inflammated nasal mucosa provokes epistaxis in these patients 2.Classically epistaxis is known to manifest bimodal incidence  with peaks in age groups of 2-10 and60-80. Only a small percentage of this population seek Otolaryngologist intervention. Thisamounts to about 1% of all patients with nasal bleed 3.You can download the complete book from here.
